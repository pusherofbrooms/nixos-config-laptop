# Pusherofbrooms' nixos and home-manager config

What are the potentially interesting parts of this config?

- allow unfree software in flake.nix
- add emacs overlay in flake.nix
- manage emacs packages in home.nix via emacs-overlay
- use some outside emacs-overlay packages that don't yet compile in the overlay.
